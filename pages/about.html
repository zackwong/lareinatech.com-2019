        <p>Leading by a senior engineer associated with Tiangong-1 in 2011, a group of hardworking engineers sweated on applying the military technologies, thick film heating technology and higher precision sensor technology, to products for civilian use.</p>
        <p>It took them 5 years to develop the technology until the first generation of Flexwarm products were simultaneously released in China and overseas markets in 2016.</p>
        <p>Comparing with existing electroheat products on the market, Flexwarm products offer a higher level of safety, energy efficiency, and comfortability, and thus, they enabled Flexwarm to get multi-million cloud funding on JD.com and Kickstarter.</p>
        <p>Taking "making the world a better place with warmth" as the core value of the brand, Flexwarm strictly sticks to the product principle: safety, professionalism, and joy.</p>
        <p>While the existing electric heating products and disposable heating products on the market are full of various safety hazards, like the risk of burning, risk of electric shock and even risk of fire, the nano-membrane technology patented by Flexwarm could turn the copper heating wire into a soft and ductile form, which enable the heating wire to be folded and pressed. In this case, the danger of short circuit is eliminated, and products become waterproof, anti-static breakdown and anti-corrosion, with a service life up to 100,000 hours.</p>
        <p>The temperature management system applied by Flexwarm is a healthy heating element that emits less radiation than a mobile phone and emits far-infrared light that is beneficial to the body. Medical studies have shown that the most beneficial far-infrared light is in the range of 4 to 14 microns, which can effectively treat inflammation and improve blood circulation. Flexwarm's temperature management system emits infrared light with a wavelength between 8 and 9 microns and thus, it is beneficial to the body in a long run.</p>
        <p>Until now, Flexwarm has developed its own core technologies such as temperature management, high precision sensor, and nano steam. It has over 200 domestic and foreign patents and won international design awards such as the iF and Red Dot in Germany for its technical application products. </p>
        <p>Flexwarm's product portfolio includes health and fashion protective equipment, intelligent wearable products and garments. </p>
        <p>Throughout continuous innovation, the Flexsteam Nano-Steam Series appliance, which is based on Flexwarm's core technology, was launched in 2018 and will revolutionize the family cleansing experience.</p>
        <p>Currently, Flexwarm's products are marketed in China and overseas, and are available on platforms such as JD.com, Tmall, Vipshop, and Xiaohongshu.</p>
